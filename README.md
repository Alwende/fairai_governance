# FairAI Governance Platform

*FairAI* is a mobile and web-based platform designed to ensure ethical AI use in Human Resources (HR) and government applications. It provides tools for auditing AI systems for bias, generating transparency reports, and logging audit trails on a blockchain for accountability. The platform addresses Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), with a focus on scalability beyond Kenya to global markets.

## Project Overview

FairAI tackles ethical challenges in AI deployment, specifically in:
- *HR*: Combating bias in hiring algorithms and ensuring fair performance reviews, addressing issues like Amazon’s 2014 biased hiring tool.
- *Government*: Ensuring transparent and accountable AI use in public services (e.g., smart cities, social welfare), aligned with NIST AI RMF and OECD AI Principles.

### Key Objectives
- *Ethical AI*: Detect and mitigate bias in AI systems.
- *Transparency*: Provide explainable AI reports.
- *Accountability*: Use blockchain for immutable audit trails.
- *Scalability*: Support multi-language and global regulations for expansion beyond Kenya.
- *SDG Alignment*:
  - *SDG 8*: Promotes fair employment through unbiased AI.
  - *SDG 10*: Reduces inequalities by mitigating bias.
  - *SDG 16*: Enhances transparency in institutions.
- *Investor Appeal*: Subscription-based model ($50/month for organizations), audit fees ($100/report), and blockchain integration attract impact investors.

   - Navigate to each service directory (backend/user-service, backend/audit-service, etc.).
   - Install dependencies:
     bash
     npm install
     
   - Create a .env file in each service:
     env
     # backend/user-service/.env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.mongodb.net/fairai
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=3000
     
     env
     # backend/audit-service/.env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.mongodb.net/fairai
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=3002
     
     env
     # backend/transparency-service/.env
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=3003
     
     env
     # backend/blockchain-service/.env
     ETHEREUM_PROVIDER=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
